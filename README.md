# ESP32 Oscilloscope Clock using a BM logo as a minute hand

This is a fork of https://github.com/maurohh/ESP32_OscilloscopeClock/

I have mainly added a )'( logo as the seconds hand. This was done by drawing the logo on a piece of paper, reading off the coordinates, typing them into Mathematica and having Mathematica make a table of these coordinates rotated in 6 degrees increments for the PROGMEM table.
